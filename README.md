# Linux Process Signals

A signal is a way to notify a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system. By their nature, they interrupt whatever the process is doing, and force it to handle them immediately.

Each signal has an integer number that represents it (1, 2 and so on), as well as a symbolic name. Each signal may have a signal handler, which is a function that gets called when
the process receives that signal. When a signal is sent to a process, the operating system stops the execution of
the process, and forces it to call the signal handler function.When that signal handler returns, the process
continues execution from wherever it stopped.

Here is a list of signals that are used with process control:
- `SIGKILL`: Kill a process (cannot be caught or ignored).
- `SIGSTOP`: Stop a process (cannot be caught or ignored).
- `SIGTSTP`: Interactive stop (Ctrl-Z).
- `SIGCONT`: Continue a stopped process.
- `SIGCHLD`: Sent by child to its parent on exit
- `SIGINT`: Interrupt a process (Ctrl-C), default action is terminating the process.
- There are 2 user defined signals `SIGUSR1`, and `SIGUSR2`. These signals can be used by users for any
purpose. (Default handler is to terminate a process)

**P.S** to get complete list of signals try `kill -l` on your terminal

A process can send a signal to another process, also the kernel sends signals to processes to report exceptions. Consider the example below, where we try to divide by zero.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int result = x / y;  // This will cause SIGFPE (signal 8) (Floating Point Exception)
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
// ./div_by_zero ; echo "Exit code: $?"
// Floating point exception (core dumped)
// Exit code: 136
// In brief, termination due to an uncaught signal results in exit status 128+<signal number>. E.g., termination by SIGINT (signal 2) results in exit status 130.
```
1. CPU executes division - Tries to divide by zero (DIV instruction)
2. CPU detects error - Triggers hardware exception (#DE - Divide Error)
3. CPU switches to kernel mode - Jumps to the divide error handler
4. Kernel handles exception - Looks up the faulting process
5. Kernel sends `SIGFPE` - Process receives signal (`SIGFPE`)
6. Process handles or terminates - If unhandled, process is killed
7. Kernel cleans up - Releases resources, schedules next process

## Signals Action
There are three different things that we can tell the kernel to do when a signal occurs. We call this ‘the disposition of the signal or the action associated with a signal’.
- Ignore the signal: This works for most signals, but there are two signals that can never be ignored `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP`.
- Catch the signal: We specify to the operating system a user-supplied function that should be called on
delivery of the signal (Like Interrupt Service Routine in DOS).
- Use the default action: The runtime environment sets up a set of default signal handlers for each process.
For example, the default signal handler for the `TERM` signal calls the `exit()` system call.

**When a process forks another one the child process inherits the parent’s signal dispositions.**

## Sending Signals to Processes
Using keyboard: Ctrl-C sends `SIGINT` to the running process, and Ctrl-Z sends `SIGTSTP`.
- Using the command line: The `kill` command can be used to send any signal to end process.
    - Example:`kill -9 <PID>`
    - You can use the process status command `ps` to find the PID of any process
- Using system calls: The `kill` system call can also be used to send signals.
    - Example: `kill(my_pid, SIGSTOP);` send to process with id = my_pid
    - Example: `raise(SIGSTOP);` send to itself

## Process Status
Common Process States in ps
- `R`	Running	- The process is currently running or ready to run (on the CPU or in the queue).
- `S`	Sleeping (Interruptible)- The process is waiting for an event (e.g., user input, disk I/O). It can be woken up by a signal.
- `D`	Uninterruptible Sleep - The process is waiting for I/O (e.g., disk or network), but cannot be interrupted by signals.
- `T`	Stopped	- The process is suspended (paused), usually due to SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z).
- `Z`	Zombie	- The process has completed execution, but its parent hasn't read its exit status yet (waiting for wait() call).

The ps command may also show extra flags next to the process state.

- `<`	High-priority (real-time scheduling).
- `N`	Low-priority (nice process).
- `s`	Session leader (a parent process for a group).
- `l`	Multi-threaded process.
- `+`	Process is running in the foreground.

## How to use your own signal handlers
There are 3 steps that gets this job done:
1. Declare and implement the signal handler
```C
void ​myHandler​(int sig_num)
{
    // Do some stuff
    printf(“Hello, I’m the new signal handler”);
}
```
2. Let the program know, that you want to use this handler (`myHandler`) to handle a signal of type X
```C
main () {
    // Some code
    signal(SIGINT, ​myHandler​);
    // Some code
}
// The signal() system call is used to set a signal handler for a signal (e.g. SIGINT, SIGUSR1)
```
3. Try it out!
```C
main () {
    // Some code
    signal(SIGINT, ​myHandler​);
    raise(SIGINT)
    // Some code
}
// When you run the program it should execute the new signal handler which prints the hello line
```

- On some UNIX/Linux systems, when a signal handler is called, the system automatically resets the signal handler for that signal to the default handler. Thus, we re-assign the signal handler immediately when entering the handler function. Otherwise, the next time this signal is received, the default handler will be executed. Even on systems that do not behave in this way, it still won't hurt, so adding this line always is a good idea.
```C
void ​myHandler​(int sig_num)
{
    // Do some stuff
    printf(“Hello, I’m the new signal handler”);
    signal(SIGINT, ​myHandler​);
}
```
- There are two pre-defined signal handler functions that we can use, instead of writing our own:
    - `SIG_IGN`  causes the process to ignore the specified signal. 
    - `SIG_DFL` causes the system to set the default signal handler for the given signal.

## Functions Wrap-up
```C
int kill(pid_t​ ​pid​, int​ ​sig)​;
```
**Description​**: The ​kill​() system call can be used to send any signal to any process group or process. If *​pid* is positive, then signal *​sig​* is sent to the process with the ID specified by ​*pid​*. If *​pid​* equals 0, then *​sig​* is sent to every process in the process group of the calling process. *sig* can be any of the signal stated above (e.g. `SIGCHLD`)
___
```C
int raise(int​ ​sig​);
```
**Description​**: sends a signal to the calling process or thread. In a single-threaded program it is equivalent
to kill(getpid(), sig). sig can be any of the above signals.
___
```C
int killpg(int​ ​pgrp,​ int​ ​sig​);
```
**Description​**: sends the signal *​sig​* to the process group *​pgrp*.​ If *​pgrp​* is 0, `​killpg​()` sends the signal to the calling process's process group. Get the calling process group id using `getpgrp()`.
___
```C
unsigned int alarm(unsigned int ​seconds​);
```
**Description**: ​causes the system to generate a `SIGALRM` signal for the process after the number of realtime seconds specified by ​seconds​ have elapsed. If there is a previous `​alarm(​)` request with time remaining, `​alarm(​)` shall return a non-zero value that is the number of seconds until the previous request would have generated a `SIGALRM` signal. Otherwise, `​alarm(​)` shall return 0.
___
```C
int pause(void);
```
**Description**: ​causes the calling process (or thread) to sleep until a signal is delivered that either
terminates the process or causes the invocation of a signal-catching function
___
```C
sighandler_t signal(int ​signum,​ sighandler_t ​handler​);
```
**Description**: ​sets the disposition of the signal ​signum​ to ​handler​, which is either `SIG_IGN`, `SIG_DFL`, or the address of a programmer-defined function (a "signalhandler").


## Implementing Timers Using Signals
Timers are important to allow one to check timeouts (e.g. wait for user input up to 30 seconds), check some conditions on a regular basis (e.g. check every 30 seconds that a server still active), and so on. The operating system gives us a simple way of setting up timers by using special alarm signals. They are generally limited to one timer active at a time, but that will suffice in simple cases. The `alarm()` system call is used to ask the system to send our process a special signal, named `ALRM`, after a given number of seconds. 

Lets see an example of how to use the `ALRM` signal:
```C
void alarm_handler(int sig_num)
{
printf("Operation timed out. Exiting...\n\n");
exit(0);
}
/* and inside the main program... */
printf("User:"); /* prompt the user for input */
alarm(30); /* start a 30 seconds alarm */
gets(user); /* wait for user input */
alarm(0); /* remove the timer if we got the user's input */
```

## Experiment Steps:
1. `signal01.c` contains a simple program with an infinite loop. Compile and run it in background. Practice using the `kill` command to send different signals to the process.
2. `signal02.c` illustrates an example of installing a user defined handler for `SIGINT`. Run the program in
background and press Ctrl-C and see what is happening.
3. Another example of installing a user defined signal handler is illustrated in `signal02.c`. The handler catches
the signal `SIGCHLD` (the termination of a child process).
4. `signal04.c` illustrates the use of `raise()` function (used for self signaling).
5. `signal05.c` shows how child process inherits the disposition of signals form its parent. Run the program and
press Ctrl-C to see the effect.
6. Sending signals to a group of processes using `killpg()` and `getpgrp()` functions is illustrated in `signal06.c`.
7. Using timers and alarm signals is illustrated in `signal07.c.`
